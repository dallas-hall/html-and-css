            Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That show's
            called a pilot. Then they show that show to the people who make
            shows, and on the strength of that one show they decide if they're
            going to make more shows. Some pilots get picked and become
            television programs. Some don't, become nothing. She starred in one
            of the ones that became nothing.

            Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a mistake! It
            all makes sense! In a comic, you know how you can tell who the
            arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact opposite of the hero. And
            most times they're friends, like you and me! I should've known way
            back when... You know why, David? Because of the kids. They called
            me Mr Glass.
