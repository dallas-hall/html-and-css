        <h1>This is the Main Heading</h1>
        <p>This text might be an introduction to the rest of
            the page. And if the page is a long one it might
            be split up into several sub-headings.</p>
        <h2>This is a Sub-Heading</h2>
        <p>Many long articles have sub-headings so to help
           you follow the structure of what is being written.
           There may even be sub-sub-headings (or lower-level
           headings)</p>
        <h2>Hi Guy, I am another Sub-Heading too.</h2>
        <p>Thanks buddy!</p>
        <p>I am not your buddy, guy.</p>
